# Introduction


The first chapter of "Building a Recommendation System with R" categorizes recommender systems as follows:

- Collaborate filters - group users of similar interest
- Content-based systems - takes the similarity of items and link to what users have liked in the past.
- Knowledge based systems - takes consideration of the items features and user preferences
- Hybrid systems - combine features of various recommender systems.

# Knowledge Based System

The Meta-Score Magic recommender system would be an example of a knowledge based system. It takes the weighted score of the of each critic and gives critics with "better quality" critiques a higher value. The article doesnâ€™t say how one would quantify a "better quality". I would suggest that they include user reviews as part of the rating . If the critic rating has a history of matching user reviews closely, their weight should be higher. Without some form of link to the real reviews, it leave the possibility of a bias on critic ratings.

# Collaborative filtering System

The Rotten Tomatoes recommender system is an example of a collaborative filtering recommender system. It takes the reviews of all viewers. When a movie review has 60% positive ratings  it gets a Tomato. The issue with this type of system was discussed in the posted "Attacks on Recommender System " article. The article shows how users can purposely give bad reviews of movies for political , social reason that are not based on an actual movie review. This recommender should include an algorithm to detect biases and hidden user agendas. 

# Content Based System

The movie recommender systems used in Netflix and Amazon  would be examples of content based recommender systems. These systems uses movies watched and /or liked in the past and recommend similar movies 

# Hybrid Recommender System

The article below shows an example of a hybrid recommender system. The examples uses the MovieLens 20M Dataset.

In this article, the hybrid recommender system uses content-based movie data and a deep entity embedding neural network that learns collaborative-based movies from ratings data. The embedding in the neural networks finds similarities in movies by using a cosine similarity score from -1 to 1. Movie vectors with a cosine similarity score closer to 1 are more similar ,  a 0 score has no similarity and q negative value are movies that are dissimilar.

# Conclusion

Overall , a hybrid system seems to be the most flexible and will very like recommend item closer to a user's preference. However, additional bias-variance tradeoff analysis will be required to draw a final conclusion.
